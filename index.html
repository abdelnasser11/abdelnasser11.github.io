        <p>
            I am running for County Commissioner to be a voice for working families. In my conversations with residents of the 17th District—Democrats,
            Republicans and Independents—I’ve seen that people are tired of politicians who care more about special interests
            than about solving problems that help working families. As your Commissioner, I will fight every day to make government
            work for the people of the 17th District.
        </p>
