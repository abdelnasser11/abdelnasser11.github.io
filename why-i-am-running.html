    I am running for County Commissioner to be a voice for working families. My dad moved from Palestine to America with just
    fifty dollars and a dream to build a better life for his family. He worked minimum wage jobs and saved money that he
    pooled with his brother to open a small business. My mom ran her own small business: two booths at a flea market that
    she used to help my sisters pay their college tuition. They emphasized to me and my siblings the importance of education,
    which they themselves were unable to get.

    I attended Harvard University where I studied Social Studies and Computer Science. I am a public administrator at the office
    of Cook County Clerk David Orr. I live with my wife, Fidaa, and our two young daughters in Justice. Fidaa, an attorney,
    served as a Library Board Trustee when we resided in Worth.

    My parents were able to work their way into the middle class while working minimum wage jobs. It saddens me to know that
    today, most people cannot do the same. That is why, like the overwhelming majority of voters, I supported Cook County’s
    minimum wage increase last year. But I watched in frustration as wealthy trustees in Western Springs—one of America’s
    richest towns—along with dozens of other towns, voted to take away this wage increase for the most vulnerable in their
    community.

    I decided to run for Commissioner because I could no longer stand by as working families continue to come under attack. In
    my conversations with residents of the 17th District—Democrats, Republicans and Independents—I’ve seen that people are
    tired of politicians who care more about special interests than about solving problems that help working families. As your
    Commissioner, I will fight every day to make government work for the people of the 17th District.
